## How to Approach a Coding Problem: A Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the problem statement carefully. Make sure you understand what is being asked, what are the inputs, and what the expected output is.

2. **Break Down the Problem**: Try to break the problem down into smaller, manageable parts. This will make it easier to tackle.

3. **Plan Your Solution**: Before you start coding, plan your solution. Write down the steps you need to take to solve the problem.

4. **Write Pseudocode**: Write pseudocode for your solution. This will help you structure your code and make the actual coding easier.

5. **Code**: Now, start coding your solution. Follow your plan and pseudocode.

6. **Test Your Solution**: After you've written your code, test it with different test cases to make sure it works as expected.

7. **Debug**: If your code doesn't work as expected, debug it. Look for any errors or places where the code doesn't behave as you thought it would.

8. **Optimize**: Once your code works, look for ways to optimize it. Can you make it faster? Can you make it more readable?

## Time Complexity Cheat Sheet

Here are some common time complexities and their implications:

- **O(1)**: Constant time complexity. The time to complete the operation does not change with the size of the input.

- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time complexity. The time to complete the operation increases logarithmically with the size of the input.

- **O(n)**: Linear time complexity. The time to complete the operation increases linearly with the size of the input.

- **O(n log n)**: Log-linear time complexity. The time to complete the operation increases log-linearly with the size of the input.

- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time complexity. The time to complete the operation increases quadratically with the size of the input.

- **O(n^3)**: Cubic time complexity. The time to complete the operation increases cubically with the size of the input.

- **O(2^n)**: Exponential time complexity. The time to complete the operation increases exponentially with the size of the input.

## Space Complexity Cheat Sheet

Here are some common space complexities and their implications:

- **O(1)**: Constant space complexity. The space required by the algorithm does not increase with the size of the input.

- **O(n)**: Linear space complexity. The space required by the algorithm increases linearly with the size of the input.

- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic space complexity. The space required by the algorithm increases quadratically with the size of the input.

- **O(n^3)**: Cubic space complexity. The space required by the algorithm increases cubically with the size of the input.

- **O(2^n)**: Exponential space complexity. The space required by the algorithm increases exponentially with the size of the input.

## Problem Solving Example: Array Sum

Let's take a simple problem: Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

### Brute Force Approach

The brute force approach would be to use two loops and check the sum of each pair of numbers. This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(1).

### Better Approach

A better approach would be to use a hash map to store the numbers and their indices. Then, for each number, we can check if the complement (target - number) is in the hash map. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).

### Optimal Approach

The optimal approach is similar to the better approach, but instead of using two separate steps (one to populate the hash map and one to find the pair), we can do it in one pass. While we iterate and inserting elements into the table, we also look back to check if current element's complement already exists in the table. If it exists, we have found a pair that adds up to the target. This approach also has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), but it is more efficient because it only requires one pass through the array.

## All Patterns Data Structure and Algorithms

Understanding patterns in data structures and algorithms can help you solve problems more efficiently. Here are some common patterns:

1. **Two Pointers or Iterators**: This pattern is often used in arrays, linked lists, and other linear data structures. It involves two pointers moving towards each other, away from each other, or in the same direction based on certain conditions.

2. **Sliding Window**: This pattern is used for array or list problems where we deal with subarrays or subsequences of a certain size.

3. **Fast and Slow Pointers**: This pattern is used in linked lists to detect cycles, find the middle element, or find the kth element from the end.

4. **Merge Intervals**: This pattern is used for problems involving intervals or ranges.

5. **Cyclic Sort**: This pattern is used for problems involving arrays containing numbers in a given range.

6. **In-place Reversal of a LinkedList**: This pattern is used for reversing linked lists in-place.

7. **Tree Breadth First Search**: This pattern is used for problems where we need to traverse a tree in a level-by-level order.

8. **Tree Depth First Search**: This pattern is used for problems where we need to traverse a tree depth-wise.

9. **Two Heaps**: This pattern is used for problems involving collections of elements where we need to find the smallest or largest element.

10. **Subsets**: This pattern is used for problems involving finding all the subsets of a given set.

11. **Modified Binary Search**: This pattern is used for problems involving binary search in a sorted array or list.

12. **Top 'K' Elements**: This pattern is used for problems involving finding the top or bottom 'k' elements from a collection.

13. **K-way Merge**: This pattern is used for problems involving merging 'k' sorted arrays.

14. **0/1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)**: This pattern is used for problems involving choosing items with maximum value under a given capacity constraint.

15. **Topological Sort (Graph)**: This pattern is used for problems involving sorting vertices of a graph in a specific order.
